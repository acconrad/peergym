# Peergym

PeerGym is a health and fitness club directory written in Elixir/Phoenix that provides equipment inventory and more in-depth information than you would find on a traditional review site like Google Reviews or Yelp.

1. Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`
2. Run `mix run priv/repo/seeds.exs` to seed the database with some sample gyms
2. Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phoenix.server`
3. (Optional) Run the tests with `mix test`. If they aren't all passing, let me know!

Now you can visit `localhost:4000` from your browser to run the app locally!
